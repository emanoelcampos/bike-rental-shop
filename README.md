# Bike Rental Shop

This project was developed as part of the **Learn Bash and SQL by Building a Bike Rental Shop** course, which is included in the [Relational Database](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/relational-database/) certification from **freeCodeCamp**. The course consists of **210 lessons** that guide the creation of an interactive `Bash` program that stores rental information for a bike rental shop using `PostgreSQL`.

## Database Diagram

This diagram provides a visual representation of the database structure, including tables, fields, and the relationships between them.

## Script and SQL Documents

The `script` and `sql` documents contain the code written during this course. They include the `SQL` queries used to interact with the database and the `Bash` scripts used to create an interactive interface for the application.

### SQL Document

The `SQL` document contains the SQL queries used to `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete` data in the `PostgreSQL` database. Through these queries, I learned how to interact with a relational database using `SQL`.

### Script Document

The Script document contains the `Bash` scripts used to create an interactive interface for the application. These scripts take user input and execute the appropriate `SQL` queries based on that input. Through these scripts, I learned how to use `Bash` to interact with a `PostgreSQL` database.

## What I Learned

Throughout the course, I gained a deep understanding of `Bash` and `SQL`. Here are some key takeaways:

- **Bash Scripting**: I learned how to create interactive scripts that can automate tasks. This included taking user input, performing actions based on conditions, and looping over data.

- **SQL and PostgreSQL**: I learned how to create, read, update, and delete data in a PostgreSQL database using SQL. This included creating tables, inserting data, querying data, updating records, and deleting records.

- **Database Design**: I learned how to design a relational database. This included understanding how to create tables and fields, define primary and foreign keys, and establish relationships between tables.

- **Data Analysis**: I learned how to analyze data stored in a database. This included writing complex SQL queries to extract meaningful information and gain insights from the data.

The SQL scripts and Bash scripts used in this project can be found in the `scripts` folder. These scripts provide practical examples of the concepts learned during the course.
